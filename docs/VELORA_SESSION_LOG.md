## Session - 10 October 2026 - Part 1 implementation

### Duck review (start of session)

**Files read:** `docs/VELORA_MERN_MASTER.pdf`, `docs/VELORA_MERN_ARCHITECTURE.pdf`,
`docs/VELORA_MERN_DUCK_LOG.pdf` (owner authority), `VELORA_MERN_10_BUILD_PROMPTS.md`, `README.md`,
`.env.example`, `.gitignore`.

**Observed repository state before changes:** an authority baseline only - `docs/` (three PDFs + the
ten build prompts) and `README.md`. No `server/`, no `client/`, no code, no CI.

**Classification:** `PLANNED` for all VEL requirements at session start.

### Work performed (Part 1)

| Area | Result |
|---|---|
| Root workspace | `package.json` workspaces (server, client), `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `scripts/gen-env-values.js` |
| Server config | fail-closed zod env (`config/env.js`), `config/db.js`, `config/constants.js` |
| Models | 10 Mongoose models with compound/unique indexes and UTC timestamps |
| Security services | Argon2id passwords, peppered hashes, AES-256-GCM secret box, opaque revocable sessions |
| Auth flows | login, logout, current-user, sessions list, revoke-all, password reset, invitation accept, TOTP enroll/verify + recovery, forced staff MFA |
| Clinic/staff | admin member management, invitations, reviewer eligibility with last-admin and self-grant invariants |
| Middleware | Helmet + CSP, exact CORS, request context, double-submit CSRF, session/clinic/permission policy, strict zod validation, safe error envelope, Mongo-backed rate limits |
| Client | Vite + React + router, cookie-only API wrapper, auth context, login/MFA/enroll/reset/invite screens, protected one-viewport app shell |
| Tests | server unit + integration (MongoDB test DB) and client Vitest suites |

### Code changes recorded as commits (Part 1)

1. `docs: initialize Velora MERN project authority`
2. `docs: add MERN Duck authority PDFs and secret-safe ignores`
3. `docs: preserve owner authority set under docs/`
4. `chore: root workspace scaffolding, env example and secret generator`
5. `feat(server): fail-closed env config, 10 Mongoose models and security services`
6. `feat(server): auth/staff API with RBAC, CSRF, MFA and rate limiting`
7. `test(server): 36 unit + integration tests covering the Part 1 exit gate`
8. `feat(client): React/Vite app - login, forced MFA enrollment, staff admin, one-viewport shell`
9. `fix(server): make MFA enrollment setup idempotent`
10. `fix(client): honour server next-step so forced MFA enrollment routes`
11. `docs: five reference documents synced with the implemented code`
12. `ci: add Part 1 pipeline gate`
13. `test(e2e): login, MFA and one-viewport browser journeys`

### Defects found and fixed during verification

- **MFA enrollment was not idempotent.** A double-fired setup (React StrictMode) or a mid-enrollment
  refresh minted a second TOTP secret, so the scanned code failed to verify. Fixed by reusing the
  existing unconfirmed secret; regression test added.
- **Client ignored the server `next` step.** Login returned `next=mfa_verify|mfa_enroll` but the auth
  context never recorded `mfaPending`, so the router bounced back to `/login`. Fixed and covered by a
  client flow test.
- **One-time recovery codes were skipped.** After enrollment the context cleared `mfaPending`, so the
  redirect effect navigated to `/app` before the user could save their recovery codes. The redirect is
  now suppressed while codes are on screen. (Found by the browser journey, not the unit tests.)
- **The authenticated screen could still scroll the whole page.** The app grid used `1fr` without
  `minmax(0, 1fr)`/`min-height: 0`, so a tall staff table grew the document instead of scrolling
  inside its panel - a genuine control #25 violation at `320x568`, `844x390` and `320x400`. The shell
  is now pinned (`position: fixed; inset: 0`) with an inner `min-height: 0` scroll region; the
  journeys assert the document does not exceed the viewport and cannot be scrolled.
- **Two production dependency advisories.** React Router 6.28 carried moderate advisories; upgraded
  to `react-router-dom` 7.18.4. `npm audit --omit=dev` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**.

### Evidence

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Server tests | `npm test -w server` | 37 pass / 0 fail (unit + integration on `velora_test`) |
| Client tests | `npm test -w client` | 6 pass / 0 fail |
| Client lint | `npm run lint -w client` | clean |
| Client build | `npm run build -w client` | production build succeeds |
| Browser journeys | `npx playwright test` | 16 pass / 0 fail (login, MFA enrollment, sign-out, safe error, redirect + six viewports) |
| Production audit | `npm audit --omit=dev` | 0 vulnerabilities |
| Secret scan (tree) | `git grep` for keys/`VITE_` secrets | no real secrets; only synthetic dev passwords |
| Secret scan (history) | `git log -p --all` for key/provider patterns | no private keys, tokens or `.env` files ever committed |

Viewport sizes asserted: `1440x900`, `768x1024`, `390x844`, `320x568`, `844x390`, `320x400`.
Advisory (dev-only, not shipped): `npm audit` still reports dev-tooling advisories in
`vite`/`vitest`/`esbuild`/`tinypool`. They are excluded from the production gate
(`--omit=dev`) and scheduled for a tooling upgrade; they do not affect a production build.

### Remaining limits

- Invitations/reset links are log-delivered in development only; no mail provider (control #22).
- No production deployment, restore test or clinical validation (Parts 10).
- Clinical permission catalog beyond `clinical.review` is declared but not yet wired to routes.
